SlowSlack
=========

An Slack launcher replacement that aims to help you minimize Slack usage.

* **Cooling off period.** Wait 10 seconds before actually launching Slack. 
* **Option to back out.** Before Slack launches, you get a chance to say "nah, nevermind!"
* **Reminder to close Slack.** After Slack has been open for 10 minutes, a popup offers to close it for you.

Installation
============

Replace the Slack launcher in your Dock with SlowSlack. Use the SlowSlack icon from now on. That's it!
